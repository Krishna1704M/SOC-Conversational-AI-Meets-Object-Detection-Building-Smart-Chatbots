Example Custom Action
Here's an example of a custom action in actions.py:
# actions.py

from typing import Any, Text, Dict, List
from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher

class ActionGreetUser(Action):

    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_greet_user"

    def run(self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
            tracker: Tracker,
            domain: Dict[Text, Any]) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:

        dispatcher.utter_message(text="Hello! How can I assist you today?")

        return []
To use this custom action, update your domain.yml to include the action:
actions:
  - action_greet_user
And update your stories.yml to call this action:
stories:
- story: greet and ask for assistance
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: action_greet_user
