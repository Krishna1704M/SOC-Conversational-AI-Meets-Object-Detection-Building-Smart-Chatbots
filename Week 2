# Learned OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING :-
OOP: (object oriented programming)
1. classes and objects
2. access modifiers
3. constructers
4. encapsulation
5. abstarction
6. inheritance
7. polymorphism
# Eample CODE for OOP :-
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
using std::string ;

/* 1. here this inherited class cannot access the private variable like (Name or Company or Age) so as we know 
 that between private & public protected space comes so if we shift Name variable to protected space it 
 can be accesed by inherited class see on 14th & implementation on the 66 line*/
/*2. in INHERITANCE we can access the only the variable not all functions running in it as the are private 
in default so in ordder to acess them we need to make the inherited class public by simply writing public in 
front of it while inheritance */
